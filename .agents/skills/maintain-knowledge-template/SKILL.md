description: Maintain or refactor the repository's default knowledge-base template without semantic drift. Use when editing packages/database/templates/default AGENTS.md guides, managed automation instructions, bootstrap document metadata, or their regression tests; when moving duplicated guidance to its proper owner; or when simplifying prompts while preserving distillation and diary behavior.

# Maintain Knowledge Template

Keep each rule in one authoritative layer and preserve behavior while improving clarity.

## 1. Establish the current contract

Start from the latest remote default branch and inspect the complete affected guidance chain,
metadata and template tests. Read recent history when wording may encode a regression fix.

Record the behaviors that must survive from the authoritative guides, managed instructions,
tests and history. Treat that as an edit-specific inventory; do not restate their rules here.

## 2. Assign one owner to every rule

Use this ownership model:

- Root `AGENTS.md`: invariants that apply to every knowledge write.
- Entity or subtree `AGENTS.md`: subject boundary, paths, local page responsibilities,
  timeline eligibility and genuine exceptions within that subtree.
- `automations/AGENTS.md`: conventions for creating and maintaining automations.
- Automation `instructions`: ordered input, processing, checkpoint, failure and reporting
  workflow only.
- Tool descriptions: argument and response semantics already enforced by the tool surface.
- Tests: semantic ownership and required behavior, not preferred prose.

Move a misplaced rule to its owner and replace copies with a link or a short instruction to
apply that guide. Do not leave two normative versions behind.

## 3. Make workflows executable

For automation edits, read the complete `automations/AGENTS.md` and the target instructions.
The guide owns shared authoring conventions; each instructions page owns its job-specific
transitions. Verify that the resulting workflow is executable without copying either contract
into this skill.

## 4. Protect information density

Treat every edit as a refactor, not an append. Do not simply add a rule to an `AGENTS.md` or
automation instruction. First make the complete affected text as clear and concise as
possible without losing behavior: remove duplication, replace or tighten overlapping prose,
and move rules to their owner. Add net-new text only for a genuinely missing behavior or
safeguard.

Before deleting guidance, classify it as:

- duplicated elsewhere: remove the copy;
- entity-specific: move it to the entity guide;
- operational: keep it in the relevant workflow step;
- regression-derived: preserve the behavior explicitly;
- merely illustrative: shorten or remove it after the rule is unambiguous.

Resolve contradictions according to the newest accepted behavior and add a regression test
for the chosen owner. Never preserve a contradiction just because both phrasings have tests.

## 5. Align metadata and tests

Check directory summaries and managed-page summaries for stale engagement, importance or
schema claims. They must not contradict the guides.

Prefer tests that assert:

- the authoritative guide contains a rule;
- descendants and automation prompts do not duplicate it;
- required workflow states, tool calls and failure behavior remain present;
- local exceptions stay in the local guide;
- known contradictory phrases are absent.

Avoid pinning full sentences unless exact wording is a runtime contract.

## 6. Validate in layers

Run focused template tests first, then type or build checks affected by structural changes.
When guidance could change extraction coverage, entity creation, timelines, links, diary
selection or checkpoint progression, add or update focused behavioral tests for that contract.

Review the final diff for rule ownership, broken guide anchors, accidental semantic loss and
word-count movement. Report any validation that could not run; never equate a shorter prompt
with a successful refactor without behavioral evidence.
